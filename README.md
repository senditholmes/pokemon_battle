# Pokemon Battle
Practicing my react skills with a card battler prototype. 

## What I learned
This was my first time dealing with multiple states and sharing them across components. I discovered a lot about the inner working of the useState hook through this project.
Fetching and displaying data with fetch(), along with error handling in typescript.

## Next steps
I would like to revisit this in the future as a 'Top Trumps' style pokemon game.
I need to focus on caching my results from the fetch calls to save some time.
Delving into how to make the game 'turn based' is going to be fun.
